To: Agent-in-Charge [Redacted] Subject: Directive 91-Z - Operation Ecliptic Veil

Agent,

This directive serves as your official orders to commence Operation Ecliptic Veil. The mission's sensitivity level is classified as BLACK. Any deviation from protocol will result in immediate countermeasures. The key details are as follows:

    Primary Objective: Secure Artifact Sigma from Facility Echo under the guise of an infrastructure inspection. This artifact holds strategic significance and must be extracted undetected.

    Team Deployment: Operative teams Omega and Theta have been activated and will rendezvous at the entry point (coordinates attached) at 0200 hours. You are responsible for overseeing coordination and ensuring operational synchronization.

    Compromised Entities: Intelligence indicates a 47% likelihood of hostile agents embedded within Facility Echo. Trust no one outside of the immediate chain of command.

    Exfiltration Plan: Upon retrieval, Artifact Sigma is to be transported via Route Delta to the extraction point at Zone 14-B. Use contingency route protocols if security is compromised.

    Disinformation Protocol: Any detected breach of operational details requires immediate activation of cover story Alpha-9. Ensure all personnel are equipped with pre-approved narratives.

    Communication Policy: All communications must be encrypted using Protocol Cipher X-59. Under no circumstances are external networks to be accessed during the operation.

Further intelligence briefings will be uploaded to your secure terminal at 1800 hours daily. Maintain operational readiness at all times. Your successful completion of this mission is essential to preserving the integrity of our directives.

The ramifications of failure are unthinkable. Exercise maximum discretion.

Signed, [Redacted] Director of Covert Affairs
